            <h3>GIRAFFE</h3>
            <p>The giraffe is the tallest land animal on Earth, known for its incredibly long neck and legs </p>
            <p>Native to the savannas and open woodlands of Africa, giraffes are gentle herbivores that live in loose social groups.</p>
            <p>Their distinctive coat patterns—unique to each individual—provide camouflage in their natural habitat</p>
            <p>Despite their height, giraffes have only seven neck vertebrae, just like humans.</p>
            <p>They use their long, prehensile tongues, which can be up to 45 cm long, to grasp foliage.</p>
            <p>Giraffes are generally quiet animals but can communicate using low-frequency sounds.</p>
            <p>Sadly, giraffe populations are declining due to habitat loss and poaching, making conservation efforts crucial for their survival.</p>
