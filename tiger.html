            <h3>TIGER</h3>
            <p>Tigers are majestic predators, known for their striking orange and black stripes. They're apex hunters, feeding on a variety of prey in their habitats. With several subspecies, tigers range from the Sundarbans' mangrove forests to Russia's birch forests.</p>
            <p> Unfortunately, tigers face significant threats, including habitat loss, poaching, and human-wildlife conflict, leading to endangered status for many subspecies. Conservation efforts focus on protecting habitats, reducing human-tiger conflict, and combating wildlife trafficking.</p>
