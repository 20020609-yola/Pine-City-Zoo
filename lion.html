            <h3>LION</h3>
            <p>Lions are majestic carnivores, known as the kings of the savanna. Found in Africa's grasslands and woodlands, they're social animals, living in prides with complex hierarchies. Lions are skilled hunters, using coordinated attacks to bring down prey. </p>
            <p>Their distinctive manes and powerful roars make them iconic symbols of the wild. Despite their majesty, lions face threats from habitat loss, human-wildlife conflict, and poaching, making conservation efforts crucial to protect these magnificent creatures.</p>

            <p>Where Can You Find Them</p>
            <p>Lions can be found in savannas, grasslands, and woodlands of Africa, particularly in countries such as South Africa, Kenya, Tanzania, and Botswana. Some notable national parks and wildlife reserves include Kruger National Park in South Africa,</p>
            <p> Maasai Mara in Kenya, Serengeti National Park in Tanzania, and Chobe National Park in Botswana. These protected areas provide habitats for lion prides, offering opportunities for wildlife viewing and conservationÂ efforts.</p>
