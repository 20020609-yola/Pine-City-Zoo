            <h3>KOALA</h3>
            <p>Koalas are adorable marsupials native to Australia, known for their fluffy fur and endearing faces. They live in eucalyptus forests, feeding on the leaves of these trees, which are toxic to most animals</p>
            <p>Koalas are arboreal, spending most of their time sleeping or eating in trees. They're iconic Australian symbols, but face threats from habitat loss, climate change, and disease. Conservation efforts focus on protecting their habitats and reducing the impact of human activity on koala populations.</p>

            <p>Where Can You Find Them</p>
            <p>Koalas can be found in the wild along the eastern coast of Australia, particularly in the states of Queensland, New South Wales, Victoria, and South Australia. They inhabit eucalyptus forests and woodlands, where their favorite food trees are abundant</p>
            <p> Some popular places to spot koalas include national parks, wildlife sanctuaries, and conservation areas. In Queensland, you can visit the Koala Coast or Lone Pine Koala Sanctuary, while in Victoria, the Great Ocean Road and Phillip Island are known as koala habitats.</p>
