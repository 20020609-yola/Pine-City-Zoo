            <h3>GORILLA</h3>
            <p>Gorillas are powerful, intelligent primates native to Africa's forests. They're social animals, living in groups led by dominant males, and communicate through vocalizations, body language, and facial expressions. </p>
            <p>Gorillas are herbivores, feeding on leaves, shoots, and fruits. Despite their strength, they're generally gentle, and conservation efforts aim to protect them from habitat loss, poaching, and disease</p>
            <p>Observing gorillas in their natural habitat offers a unique glimpse into their complex social behavior and emotional depth.</p>
           
            <p>Where Can You Find Them</p>
            <p>Gorillas can be found in the wild in central Africa, specifically in the forests of countries such as Rwanda, Uganda, and the Democratic Republic of Congo.</p>
            <p>They inhabit mountainous regions, like the Virunga Mountains, and lowland forests. Some notable places to observe gorillas include Volcanoes National Park in Rwanda, Bwindi Impenetrable National Park in Uganda</p>
