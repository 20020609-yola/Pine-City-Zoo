            <h3>WARTHOG</h3>
            <p>Warthogs are sturdy, ground-dwelling pigs found in Africa's savannas and grasslands. They're recognizable by their distinctive facial "warts" and curved tusks. Warthogs are herbivores, feeding on grasses, roots, and fruits.</p>
            <p>They're known for their speed and agility, often running with their tails held high. Warthogs play an important role in their ecosystems, and are often seen grazing in open areas or seeking shelter in burrows.</p>

            <p>Where Can You Find Them</p>
            <p>Warthogs can be found in various parts of Africa, including savannas, grasslands, and open woodlands. They inhabit countries such as South Africa, Kenya, Tanzania, and Botswana.</p>
            <p>Some popular national parks and wildlife reserves for spotting warthogs include Kruger National Park in South Africa, Maasai Mara in Kenya, Serengeti National Park in Tanzania, and Chobe National Park in Botswana. They're widely distributed across the African continent, particularly in areas with suitable grasslands and open spaces.</p>
