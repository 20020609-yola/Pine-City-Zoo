            <h3>MONKEY</h3>
            <p>Monkeys are intelligent and agile primates, found in tropical forests and savannas worldwide. They're social creatures, living in troops with complex hierarchies, and communicate through vocalizations, facial expressions, and body language.</p>
            <p>Monkeys are known for their curiosity and mischievous behavior, often swinging through trees with ease. With diverse species, they range from tiny pygmy marmosets to larger mandrills, each with unique characteristics and adaptations to their environments.</p>

            <p>Where Can You Find Them</p>
            <p>Specific locations like Costa Rica's cloud forests, Uganda's Kibale National Park, and Bali's Ubud Monkey Forest are popular spots for monkey sightings. They inhabit a range of environments, from dense forests to grasslands and even urban areas.</p>
