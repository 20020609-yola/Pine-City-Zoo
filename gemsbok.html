            <h3>GEMSBOK</h3>
            <p>Gemsbok are striking antelopes native to southern Africa, known for their distinctive long, straight horns that can grow up to 1 meter long in both males and females. </p>
            <p>These desert-dwelling animals are well-adapted to arid environments, conserving water and withstanding high temperatures</p>
            <p> Gemsbok are herbivores, feeding on grasses, leaves, and fruits, and often live in small herds led by a dominant female.</p>
            <p>With their impressive horns and resilient nature, gemsbok are iconic creatures in southern African savannas and deserts.</p>
