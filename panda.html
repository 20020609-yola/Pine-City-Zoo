            <h3>PANDA</h3>
            <p>Pandas are iconic black-and-white bears native to China's bamboo forests. They're herbivores, feeding almost exclusively on bamboo, and have specialized digestive systems to break down cellulose. Pandas are gentle giants, known for their distinct markings and calm demeanor.</p>
            <p> Due to habitat loss and low birth rates, pandas are considered vulnerable, but conservation efforts, such as breeding programs and habitat protection, aim to preserve these beloved animals and their unique ecosystems.</p>
